A furry Discord bot, also known as magicalbunny31's project!

---

#### This page is intended for the following bots:
> **discord-bunny-bot**<br/>
> **discord-fox-kit-bot**

---

APIs I use here are for my bot and for the usage for others.
I do not intend to cause any harm using them.

If you're looking for image credit, you'll find them in a folder named [`credit`](https://github.com/magicalbunny31/discord-bunny-bot-public/tree/main/credit "Click this to jump to the folder!") here.

The folder [`images`](https://github.com/magicalbunny31/discord-bunny-bot-public/tree/main/images "cClick this to jump to the folder!") is for (temporary) image hosting. You can find out more by reading the [`readme`](https://github.com/magicalbunny31/discord-bunny-bot-public/tree/main/images#readme "Click this to jump to the folder!").

If for whatever reason you need to contact me about API usage and heck like that, you can do so by send me a message over at my [Discord server / support guild for bunny](https://discord.gg/5cE7AjX), or send me an [email](mailto:dzeiun@googlemail.com).

Please do not hesitate to contact me (via above) regarding concerns with anything in this repository. I won't bite ya!

Finally, I do not generate any revenue for this bot, bunny. And I do not plan to in the future. This is a non-profit hobby and a little project of mine too.

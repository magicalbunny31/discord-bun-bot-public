# bunny


A furry Discord bot, also known as magicalbunny31's project!
*"Huh? Another furry Discord bot?"*

---

APIs I use here are for my bot and for the usage for others.
I do not intend to cause any harm using them.

If you're looking for image credit, you'll find them in a folder appropriately here.

If for whatever reason you need to contact me about API usage and heck like that, you can do so by send me a message over at my [Discord server / support guild for bunny](https://discord.gg/5cE7AjX), or send me an [email](mailto:dzeiun@googlemail.com).

This bot isn't open source. It is stored here in a private repo for versioning.

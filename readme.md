A furry Discord bot, also known as magicalbunny31's project!

---

APIs I use here are for my bot and for the usage for others.
I do not intend to cause any harm using them.

If you're looking for image credit, you'll find them in a folder named `credit` here.

If for whatever reason you need to contact me about API usage and heck like that, you can do so by send me a message over at my [Discord server / support guild for bunny](https://discord.gg/5cE7AjX), or send me an [email](mailto:dzeiun@googlemail.com).

Please do not hesitate to contact me (via above) regarding concerns with anything in this repository. I won't bite ya!

Finally, I do not generate any revenue for this bot, bunny. And I do not plan to in the future. This is a non-profit hobby and a little project of mine too.

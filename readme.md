APIs I use here are for my bot and for the usage for others.
I do not intend to cause any harm using them.

If for whatever reason you need to contact me about API usage and heck like that, you can do so by [opening an issue on this repository](https://github.com/magicalbunny31/discord-bunny-bot-public/issues/new "Click this to open an issue!"), sending me a message over at my [Discord server / support guild for bunny](https://discord.gg/5cE7AjX "Click this to join my Discord server!"), or by sending me an **email** (dzeiun[at]googlemail[dot]com).

Please do not hesitate to contact me (via above) regarding concerns with anything in this repository. I won't bite ya!

Finally, I do not generate any revenue for this bot, bunny. This is (currently) a non-profit hobby and a little project of mine too.

A furry Discord bot made for helping make your server just that little bit better!<br/>
..*Ambitious, right?*

#### This page is intended for the following bots:
> **discord-bunny-bot**<br/>
> **discord-fox-kit-bot**

---

APIs I use here are for my bot and for the usage for others.
I do not intend to cause any harm using them.

If you're looking for image credit, you'll find them in a folder named [`credit`](https://github.com/magicalbunny31/discord-bunny-bot-public/tree/main/credit "Click this to jump to the folder!") here.

The folder [`images`](https://github.com/magicalbunny31/discord-bunny-bot-public/tree/main/images "Click this to jump to the folder!") is for (temporary) image hosting. You can find out more by reading the [`readme`](https://github.com/magicalbunny31/discord-bunny-bot-public/tree/main/images#readme "Click this to jump to the folder!").

If for whatever reason you need to contact me about API usage and heck like that, you can do so by [opening an issue on this repository](https://github.com/magicalbunny31/discord-bunny-bot-public/issues/new "Click this to open an issue!"), sending me a message over at my [Discord server / support guild for bunny](https://discord.gg/5cE7AjX "Click this to join my Discord server!"), or by sending me an [email](mailto:dzeiun@googlemail.com "Click this to start writing an email addressed to me!").

Please do not hesitate to contact me (via above) regarding concerns with anything in this repository. I won't bite ya!

Finally, I do not generate any revenue for this bot, bunny. This is (currently) a non-profit hobby and a little project of mine too.

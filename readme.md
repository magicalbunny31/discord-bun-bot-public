![bunny](https://github.com/magicalbunny31/discord-bunny-bot-public/blob/master/images/bunny.png)

A furry Discord bot, also known as magicalbunny31's project!

---

APIs I use here are for my bot and for the usage for others.
I do not intend to cause any harm using them.

If you're looking for image credit, you'll find them in a folder named `credit` here.

If for whatever reason you need to contact me about API usage and heck like that, you can do so by send me a message over at my [Discord server / support guild for bunny](https://discord.gg/5cE7AjX), or send me an [email](mailto:dzeiun@googlemail.com).

This bot isn't open source. The code is stored elsewhere in a private repo for versioning.
